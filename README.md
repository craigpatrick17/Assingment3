Craig Patrick: goer9789, great job on this. I ran the code from your assignment in my android emulater on my Mac, and it worked perfectly. All of the tea bands showed up in the emulator. I was also able to access the camera function and it worked as it was supposed to. I could see in your code that it was programmed correctly. Also, just one piece of advice when writing your code: It is fine to have your code be all over the place when you are writing it out, but what helps me the most is when I am done writing it, I like to organize the code so that the 'var win1' is first followed by its display and functionality, then 'var win2' would follow with display and functionality after that, just to keep everything organized. Great job! I'm glad it worked for you!
